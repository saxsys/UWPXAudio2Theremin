# UWPXAudio2Theremin
Simple Theremin App for the Universal Windows Platform using XAudio2.

Hi,

I'm learning both C++ and Xaudio 2 and have found UWPXAudio2Theremin to be an excellent example of good programming from which I've learned a lot.

I've noticed a few things which I feel are worth changing and have explained these in the document "Theremin clicks & 16bit v1.docx". I've changed the AudioComponent.h and AudioComponent.cpp files. I've done this as a branches JBradon-patch-1. 

I'm sorry that I don't know how to use Github very well yet. I would have liked to send this as a email message and save my Word document as .md rather that .docx.
